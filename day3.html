    Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu
    family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his
    mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas,
    and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam
    Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10]
    According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a
    mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill,
    and request his father to bowl to him.[11] In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket
    Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd
    espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old
    Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon
    the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his
    son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing
    abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his
    abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the
    under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli
    reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which
    would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli
    eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received
    training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the
    Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[15] In pursuit of
    furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School
    during his ninth-grade education
